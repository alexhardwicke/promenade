Promenade
=============

Alex's Project written for a 120 hour assignment for an Android course at Umeå University.


Notes
------------

This was my first major programming project, and also my second ever experience with Android.

The code is riddled with comments - more than is necessary and to the point of excess. This was a combination of a lack of experience, expectations by teachers and wanting to make sure that I didn't forget what the code did.

Likewise, this code has not been updated since September 2012. It relies on the old Google Maps API and old libraries.


Use of Source
------------

I am providing this code as-is. The project was a summer project and I have since abandoned it. I do not plan to add any more features or do anything with the application.

Promenade is available on Google Play [here][promenadelink]. If you choose to fork Promenade and update it, I can if requested put up the updated version with appropriate credit to you.
